		Instructions:  
	1. In your portfolio site, create a new page named dom.html
    2. In the body of your html, create a new <div> element to use as a container for new paragraphs that we'll add with JS
    3. Utilize css to put an outline around the container div, set the width to 80% or less, and center it on the page.
    4. You may want to temporarily put a paragraph into the div and check the site to ensure that the spacing is correct.
	Be sure to remove any tests that you place in the container before moving on.
    5. Create a new variable, and set it equal to the container div
    6. Utilize a loop to do the following with each iteration:
        a. Create a new <p> element, with some text inside of it
        b. Place that <p> element inside of the container div
        c. Repeat this 5 times.
    7. Create a new function that changes the background color of the body to one color, 
	and the background color of the container div to another. Please be sure to also set 
	the text color of the container div to something that contrasts against the background color, 
	if black does not.
    8. Create a button and set its onclick attribute to the function from step 7.
    9. Push your changes to github, then submit a link to the dom.html page to this assignment.
